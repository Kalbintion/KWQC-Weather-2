I	[01INS]	Installation
-------------------------------------------
In order to install this application simply
unzip the files included in this program to
any location and run the executable file.
Please note that it is recommended to have
a SHORTCUT placed to the desktop instead of
the files themselves due to the files made
by the program to reduce clutter chances.
If there are any problems please contact
the author in the section labeled 'Contact'
The only required files other than what is
here are the Visual Basic Run Time Files.
Which should not be required since most of
the newer computers have that information
on the computer upon receiving.
